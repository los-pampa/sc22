I. Description
--------------

This README describes the steps needed to create the Docker image with ITT support.


II. File list
-------------

Dockerfile	contains the information related to the image that will be created.
gcc_build.zip	file that has the gcc builded in a "zip". This file has been generated in previous steps of the README.


III. Generating the image
-------------------------

A. To generate an image with the ITT enabled, please, do the following steps:
	- Open Dockerfile and edit the following lines:
		* line 2: change "COPY ./gcc.zip /home" to "COPY ./gcc_build.zip /home" accordingly to the name of gcc_build.zip defined by the user.
		* line 3: rename all "gcc.zip" to the name of gcc_build.zip defined by the user.
	- Save and close Dockerfile.

B. Command to build the image:
	- Run the following command line: "docker build --tag=sc22 .", where sc22 can be replaced by the name of the image. Here, we consider that sc22 is the name.

C. Check if the build has succesfully completed:
	- Run the following command line: "docker image ls". If everything goes well, the image sc22 will appear in the list.

D. Once the image has been created, please, return to the main README for the next steps.
